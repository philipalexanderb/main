== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== [Proposed] Undo/Redo feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

=== Generate meeting timeslot
==== Description of Feature

The timeslot generator is used to suggest meeting timings by making use of team members' timetable.

[NOTE]
This feature makes heavy use of the class `TimeRange`, which represents a period of time in a week, e.g. MONDAY 1000 -- MONDAY 1200.

The main logic of this feature is contained within the `TimeSlotGenerator` class:

`TimeSlotGenerator(members, desiredMeetingDuration, restrictedTimeRange)`

* `members`: `List<TimeTable>` of members of the checked-out `Project`
* `desiredMeetingDuration`: How long the meeting would last in hour, expressed as a positive integer
* `restrictedTimeRange`: Sets the limit of generated `TimeRange`, e.g. restrict meeting to working hours, from MONDAY 0900 - MONDAY 1800

Only the two following methods are exposed:

* `TimeSlotGenerator#generate()` -- Generate timeslot suitable for *_all_* `TimeTable` supplied. Returns a list of `TimeRange`, or an empty list of `TimeRange` if no such timeslot is available.
* `TimeSlotGenerator#generateWithMostMembers()` -- Generate timeslot where *_most_* members of the currently checked out project are available. Returns a list of `TimeRange`.

==== Details

This feature depends on the timetable stored internally as an attribute of each members:

image::GenerateSlotClassDiagram.png[]

Typical usage of `TimeSlotGenerator` would be look like this:

`List<TimeRange> availableTimeSlots = new TimeSlotGenerator(members, desiredMeetingDuration, restrictedTimeRange).generate()`

The following sequence diagram shows the entire process of generating timeslot after the command `generate d/2` is given:

image::GenerateSlotSequenceDiagram.png[]

As shown in the sequence diagram above, the command execution would go through the following stages:

. Fetch the data of members in the current project and pass them to the `TimeSlotGenerator`.
. `TimeSlotGenerator` will extract their timetable and generate all possible `TimeRange`.
. Display result for the user to view all the possible timeslots that a meeting can be held.

[NOTE]
If `generate()` returns an empty `List<TimeRange>`, the program should automatically call `generateWithMostMembers()` and return it as result, informing the user that there is no timeslot where all members are available.

The following activity diagram summarizes the general flow of the command `generate`:

.`generate` command tries to provide best possible meeting timeslot
image::GenerateSlotActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Algorithm Used

===== `TimeSlotGenerator#generate()`

. Combine all the given `TimeTable` into a single `List<TimeRange> combined`
. `combined` is then processed further by merging overlapping `TimeRange` into a single `TimeRange`. E.g. `TimeRange(MONDAY, 1000, MONDAY, 1200)` and `TimeRange(MONDAY, 1200, MONDAY,1400)` are merged together to form a single `TimeRange(MONDAY, 1000, MONDAY, 1400)`. `List<TimeRange> merged` is then passed on to the next stage.
. `merged` is then inverted, and returns `List<TimeRange> inverted` containing all timeslots where all the members are free.
. `inverted` is then processed to ensure that all `TimeRange` falls within `restrictedTimeRange` specified by the user, truncating all `TimeRange` that extends beyond the specified `restrictedTimeRange`, returning `List<TimeRange> truncated`.
. The algorithm then filters `inverted` by rejecting all `TimeRange` that last shorter than `desiredMeetingDuration` specified by the user. This `List<TimeRange> accepted` is then passed back to the caller of this method, and the algorithm terminates.

===== `TimeSlotGenerator#generateWithMostMembers()`

. Iterates over all possible combinations of timetables in descending order of number of timetable.
. For each possible combination, call `TimeSlotGenerator#generate()`.
. If `TimeSlotGenerator#generate()` returns an empty list, repeat step 2 again.
. Algorithm terminates, returning the combination of List<TimeTable> used and available timings `List<TimeRange>` wrapped in a class `TimeSlotWithMember`.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to generate timeslot with most number of available members

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Iterate over all possible combinations of timetables, sorted in descending order of number of timetables, and call `TimeSlotGenerator#generate()` on each of these combinations.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of speed. This implementation takes O(2^n^) time for _n_  members.
* **Alternative 2:** Use a more sophisticated algorithm, like a segment tree.
** Pros: Will use much less time.
** Cons: Harder to implement, and more specialize towards only doing a single task.

We went with options 1 as there is no real difference in speed if the number of members is restricted to below 15 members, which many projects do not normally exceed. It is much easier to understand and maintain by other developers as well.

=== Timetable input
==== Description of Feature
There are two ways to input member's timetable

. Member send a formatted text file to the team leader, which would then be parsed by the system
. Member send their NUSMods timetable URL to the team leader, and the system would fetch their timetable data using NUSMods API

The main logic is implemented within the `AddTimetableCommand` class.

==== Details

Important functions in the `AddTimetableCommand`:

* `AddTimetableCommand#getTimetableFromNUSMods(String url)` -- Fetch timetable data using NUSMods API
* `AddTimetableCommand#getTimetableFromFile(String filepath)` -- Parse file to obtain timetable data

An overview of how the `AddTimetableCommand` class works, shown in figure below:

<INSERT CLASS DIAGRAM, SHOW DEPENDENCIES>

User command would be in the format: `addTimetable m/member [u/url] [f/filepath]`

Below diagram shows the entire process of adding timetable from file:

<INSERT SEQUENCE DIAGRAM FOR FILE INPUT>

Alternatively, user can input using NUSMods shared timetable URL.

Following sequence diagram would delve directly into the process of fetching timetable data using NUSMods API, as the earlier portion of command parsing is similar to the above figure.

<INSERT SEQUENCE DIAGRAM, starting directly from getTimetableFromNUSMods>


==== Design Considerations (DO I EVEN NEED THIS PORTION???)

===== Aspect: How to input timetable

Alternatively, we can input timetable on the command line manually, but we realized that it is too troublesome and unrealistic for the user to type in so much timetable data of his many members.


// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
