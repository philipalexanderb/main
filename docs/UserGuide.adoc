= MyProject User Guide:

== Introduction:

MyProject (MP) is for team leaders who prefer to use a desktop app for managing their projects.
MP is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
With MP it is a one-stop app to store and manage your projects and their relevant information,
this is especially useful if you are always managing multiple projects across different teams.
