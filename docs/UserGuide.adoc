== Introduction:

MyProject (MP) is for team leaders who prefer to use a desktop app for managing their projects.
MP is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
With MP it is a one-stop app to store and manage your projects and their relevant information,
this is especially useful if you are always managing multiple projects across different teams.
MP has unique functions such as sending emails to members within the app and financial tracking capabilities etc.
Currently our app is optimized  for students to use but we intend to expand further to working adults as well.

=====  Add a member to your project

Adding a member can be done in 2 ways, you can either add a new person to your contacts and to your current project,
or you can simply add an existing person from your contacts to your current project.


====== 1. Add a new member: `addMember` [Checkout]

This command is similar to adding a person to your contacts shown previously, except that you have to be
checked out into a project. +
Format: `addMember n/NAME [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [a/address] [t/tag]...`

[TIP]
Adding a member only requires his/her name!

However it will be good to add as much information as possible.

Example:

* `addMember n/John Doe a/John street, block 123, #01-01`

* `addMember n/Betsy Crowe e/betsycrowe@example.com t/friend t/criminal`


====== 2. Add from your contacts: `addFromContacts` [Checkout]

This command helps to add a person you already saved in your contacts into your project, reducing the need
to type his information all over again. All you need to do is enter the index he is listed at. +
Format: `addFromContacts INDEX`


`INDEX` is the number which the person is listed at, and it should be a positive integer eg. 1, 2, 3, ....


Example:

* `addFromContacts 1`

==== Add a timetable: `addTimetable`

Need to keep track of your team members' schedule? Use this command to record down their timetable easily!

[TIP]
Timetable added can be used to generate avaiable meeting timeslots using the command `generate`

Example:

* `addTimetable 3 f//home/john/Desktop/aliceTimetable.txt` +
Add Alice's timetable to Alice, who has index 3 in the list of persons.

[NOTE]
File should be formatted as a newline separated list of time ranges, e.g: +
MONDAY 1000 MONDAY 1200 +
MONDAY 1400 MONDAY 1600 +
TUESDAY 1100 TUESDAY 1500

* `addTimetable 2 n/https://nusmods.com/timetable/sem-1/share?CS2100=LAB:05,TUT:02,LEC:1&CS2101=&CS2103T=LEC:G13&CS2105=TUT:03,LEC:1&CS3241=TUT:05,LEC:1&CS3243=TUT:01,LEC:1&GEQ1000=TUT:D27` +
Add timetable to the person with index 2 on the list of persons, by retrieving timetable data from NUSMods.

Below is a step-by-step instruction to guide you through the process of adding a timetable to Alice, through the use of NUSMods:

* Step 1: Type `addTimetable`, followed by the index of the person you wish to add the timetable to, and the URL of the share link.
