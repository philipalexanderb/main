== Introduction to the project

My team of 4 NUS SoC students and I were tasked to enhance a command line addressbook application. We decided to convert it into a one-stop project management app called *_MyProject_*.

MyProject is meant to aid NUS students in managing multiple projects within a single desktop application that can fufill all their needs.

Aside from basic features such as setting of tasks and deadlines, MyProject also boasts several tools to aid users in better managing their projects. Notable features include:

* Keep track of members' progress
* Send out email reminders
* Record meeting minutes
* Track project budget
* Generate meeting timings (My Contributions)

This is what our project look like:

This document serves to record down my contributions to the project in detail.

== Summary of contributions

*Enhancement*: Implemented `setTimetable` and `generate` command. `setTimetable` records down a member's schedule, while `generate` suggests timings to schedule meetings on.

* *What it does*:
** The `setTimetable` command is primarily used to support the `generate` command by recording members' schedule. The `setTimetable` command  is made extremely convenient for NUS students due to our integration with NUSMods timetable sharing feature, allowing users to simply input a NUSMods timetable sharing URL, instead of having to enter all the timings manually.
** The `generate` command suggest the most suitable timeslots to schedule project meetings on, based on the timetable of members added using the `setTimetable` command.
* *Justification*
** Team leaders often have trouble scheduling team meetings, having to run to every single members and ask for their availability at a certain timeslot. This process is often time consuming and inefficient. With this enhancement, team leaders can avoid this issue entirely by simply entering a database of team members' timetables into *_MyProject_* using the command `setTimetable`, and generate meeting timeslots using the command `generate`.

* *Highlights*
** I tried to make this enhancement to be very convenient to use, with only 2 commands required for this functionality to work. This led to the high variety of errors that the `generate` and `setTimetable` command can occur. As such, I had to provide a robust error catching mechanism to identify what the user did wrongly and provide suggestion on how to make the command work.
** This enhancement was also challenging because the current Java data and time libraries do not fully address my needs for a weekly recurring type of timetable, thus I had to implement it myself, which proves to be more of a challenge than expected. However, this proved to be worth the time, as it forms the backbone of the entire enhancement. This allowed for my enhancement to be extremely extendable so that we can easily provide for more sources of input, such as input from .ics files.

== Contributions to the User Guide

We had to provide a user guide as an instruction for how to use our software. The user guide consist of mainly different commands and the various arguments they take.

Below is the section of user guide that I contributed for my tasks.
